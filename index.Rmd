> Lynn Ann Conway (born January 2, 1938) is an American computer scientist,
electrical engineer, inventor, and transgender activist. Conway is notable for
a number of pioneering achievements. She worked at IBM in the 1960s and is
credited with the invention of **generalized dynamic instruction handling**, a key
advance used in **out-of-order execution**, used by most modern computer processors
to improve performance. -- ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Conway))
